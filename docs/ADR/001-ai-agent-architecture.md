# ADR-001: AI Agent Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2024-01-15

## Context
CoreFlow360 V4 requires an intelligent system to handle complex business operations across multiple departments. We need to design an architecture that can:
- Support hundreds of specialized AI agents
- Handle multi-agent collaboration
- Maintain cost efficiency
- Ensure reliable performance
- Enable easy addition of new agents

## Decision
We will implement a **Plugin-Based Agent Registry Architecture** with the following components:

1. **Central Agent Registry** - Manages agent lifecycle and discovery
2. **Capability-Based Routing** - Routes tasks based on required capabilities
3. **Orchestrator Pattern** - Coordinates multi-agent workflows
4. **Memory System** - Maintains context across interactions
5. **Cost Tracking** - Monitors and controls AI usage costs

### Architecture Overview
```

│   Client    │────▶│  Orchestrator│────▶│   Registry  │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └─────────────┘
                            │                     │
                            ▼                     ▼
                    ┌──────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
                    │    Memory    │      │   Agents    │
                    └──────────────┘      └─────────────┘
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Scalability**: Can easily add new agents without modifying core system
- **Flexibility**: Different agents can use different AI providers
- **Cost Control**: Granular tracking and budget enforcement
- **Reliability**: Automatic failover and retry mechanisms
- **Performance**: Intelligent routing minimizes latency

### Negative
- **Complexity**: More moving parts to manage
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand the plugin architecture
- **Overhead**: Registry and orchestration add some latency

### Risks
- Agent proliferation could make the system hard to manage
- Cost tracking might add performance overhead
- Memory system could become a bottleneck

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Monolithic AI Service
- **Pros**: Simpler architecture, easier debugging
- **Cons**: Hard to scale, single point of failure
- **Rejected because**: Doesn't support specialized agents well

### 2. Microservices per Agent
- **Pros**: Complete isolation, independent scaling
- **Cons**: High operational overhead, complex deployment
- **Rejected because**: Too complex for initial version

### 3. Serverless Functions
- **Pros**: Auto-scaling, pay-per-use
- **Cons**: Cold starts, limited execution time
- **Rejected because**: Not suitable for stateful workflows

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1: Core System
- Implement Registry, Orchestrator, and Claude integration
- Basic capability routing
- Simple memory system

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Advanced memory management
- Cost optimization

### Phase 3: Specialized Agents
- Department-specific agents
- Custom agent framework
- Agent marketplace
