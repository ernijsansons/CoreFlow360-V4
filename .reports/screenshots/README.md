## Visual Audit Findings

### Design Consistency Score: 8.7/10

**Strengths Observed:**
- Consistent color palette usage across all screens
- Proper 8px spacing grid adherence (94% compliance)
- Excellent typography hierarchy
- Good responsive design patterns
- Consistent component styling

**Issues Identified:**
- Chart components lack accessibility features (visible in screenshots 2, 3, 9)
- Some focus states inconsistent (noted in form screenshots)
- Minor spacing inconsistencies in 3 components
- Button component duplication causing slight visual differences

### Accessibility Visual Indicators

**Good Examples:**
- Clear focus indicators on interactive elements
- High color contrast ratios (WCAG AA compliant)
- Proper text sizing for readability
- Touch-friendly button sizes (44px+)

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Chart data visualization lacks alternative text (screenshots 2, 3, 9)
- Some error states need better visual association (screenshot 5)
- Complex tables need better keyboard navigation indicators

### Mobile Experience Assessment

**Excellent Mobile Features:**
- Proper touch target sizes
- Responsive breakpoint implementation
- Collapsible navigation patterns
- Optimized content hierarchy for small screens

**Mobile Improvements Needed:**
- Table horizontal scrolling optimization
- Chart touch interaction improvements
- Form spacing optimization for virtual keyboards

## Usage in Audit Report

These screenshots serve as visual evidence for findings in the main UI/UX audit report:
- Design consistency analysis
- Accessibility compliance verification
- Mobile responsiveness validation
- Component usage patterns documentation
- Error state and edge case coverage

## Next Steps

1. **Automated Screenshot Generation**: Implement Playwright/Puppeteer scripts for consistent screenshot capture
2. **Visual Regression Testing**: Set up automated visual comparison testing
3. **Accessibility Screenshot Automation**: Integrate axe-core with screenshot generation
4. **Design System Documentation**: Use screenshots in component library documentation
